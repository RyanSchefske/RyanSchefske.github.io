# First Post

---

<br/>I've always been interested in the world of content creation, especially surrounding Swift and iOS Development. 
However, I never went through with it. That is until today!<br/>

I have decided to make 2022 my year of expanding my community, creating content, and helping people
learn Swift and iOS Development. More than that, I have decided to start a blog for myself!
When I inevitably forget some simple syntax, I'll have a place to look back at my work and refresh my memory.

## What to expect

I am hoping to release a new blog every week. Alongside blog posts, I want to create YouTube videos for different tutorials that I will run through.
If there is interest, I will also post a weekly Swift challenge for developers to learn new skills or solidify the Swift fundamentals. 

<br/>### Conclusion
<br/>I am looking forward to this journey, and hope to connect with everyone along the way!
